  <h3>Our translator app! Can translate English, Russian, French, and Spanish!</h3>
    <img src="image/MITApp.png" height="500" width="250">
     <p>1. Our project was a translator, which could translate Russian, English, French, and Spanish.

        2. It did work, but I messed up the user interface and created a non-usable delete button that was later deleted.

        3. Our product could be better by adding in a voice record feature that would convert that person's speech to text and be able to translate from that. It could also be used to translate even more languages and be able to translate those languages instead of having to translate from English to some other foreign language.

        4. Under the assumption that we aren't abusing the rights and violating the Yandex translator, we would be able to sell this as a product, perhaps to a traveler going to a foreign country, who could use the app to make their lives easier.

  <h5>Our Python GPA calculator, made by Ryan Oh and Terrence DDMagee.</h5>
  <p>1. The most interesting project was the GPa calculator.
     2. The most challenging project to write was the Python story, as I messed up the code and had to redo it again. 
     3. The most creative story was the Python story, as we had to think about different scenarios and think outside the box.</p>
