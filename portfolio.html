  <h3>Our translator app! Can translate English, Russian, French, and Spanish!</h3>

     <p>1. Our project was a translator, which could translate Russian, English, French, and Spanish.

        2. It did work, but I messed up the user interface and created a non-usable delete button that was later deleted.

        3. Our product could be better by adding in a voice record feature that would convert that person's speech to text and be able to translate from that. It could also be used to translate even more languages and be able to translate those languages instead of having to translate from English to some other foreign language.

        4. Under the assumption that we aren't abusing the rights and violating the Yandex translator, we would be able to sell this as a product, perhaps to a traveler going to a foreign country, who could use the app to make their lives easier.
